# NED_download
Scripts to download NED tiles from input imagery


## Completed
 - Add handling for tiles with different naming convention (e.g. n39w108.zip instead of more standard USGS_NED_13_n39w108_IMG.zip)  
 - Add auto-handling for imagery that spans multiple tiles (mosaic, and proper naming for downstream scripts)
